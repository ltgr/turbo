A cross-platform emoji manager that lets you insert emojis into any app you want!

## Installation

### Cross-Platform
On any system just downloading the .jar file in [releases]() and doing `java -jar turbo.jar` should do the trick.

### Windows
Download the .exe file  from [releases]() and run it, you can set it to autopen at startup in settings if you want it to run in the background.

### Mac
Download and open the .dmg file in [releases]() and drag the turbo icon into applications.

### Linux
Download the .AppImage file in [releases]() and run it.

## How it works
Turbo uses:
- jnativehook([org.jnativehook](https://github.com/kwhat/jnativehook)) for global hotkeys
- Other built in libraries like javax.swing for its GUI
